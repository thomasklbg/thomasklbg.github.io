I'm a Research Associate at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) and an Associate Member of the [Department of Computer Science]((https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/)) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), advised by [Marta Kwiatkowska](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=ArcH6PkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Lukasz Szpruch](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~lszpruch/). 




My research interests broadly span topics in reinforcement learning and algorithmic game theory. I'm especially interested in problems connecting these two areas such as learning in games and mechanism design under uncertainty.

I did my PhD at the University of Oslo, supervised by [Christos Dimitrakakis](https://sites.google.com/site/christosdimitrakakis) (yet to defend). Prior to that I studied Mathematics the University of MÃ¼nster and the University of British Columbia. 
I'm a third-year PhD student at the University of Oslo supervised by [Christos Dimitrakakis](https://sites.google.com/site/christosdimitrakakis).
My research interests broadly span topics in reinforcement learning and algorithmic game theory, and I'm especially interested in problems connecting these two areas (e.g., learning in games and incentive-aware learning).
