I'm a 3rd year PhD student at the University of Oslo supervised by [Christos Dimitrakakis](https://sites.google.com/site/christosdimitrakakis).
Before, I studied mathematics at the University of MÃ¼nster, where I was advised by Gerold Alsmeyer and Zakhar Kabluchko. 
I also completed part of my master's in the Probability Group at the University of British Columbia hosted by Edwin Perkins. 

My research interests broadly span reinforcement learning (e.g., bandits, reward learning) and game theory. I'm especially interested in the intersection of online learning and game theory. Here, I currently focus on connecting bandit learning and mechanism design. 
Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about these or any related topics.
