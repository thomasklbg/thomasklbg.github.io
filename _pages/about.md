I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} 
and an Associate Member of the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, where I'm advised by [Marta Kwiatkowska](https://www.trinity.ox.ac.uk/people/marta-kwiatkowska){:target="_blank"} and 
[Lukasz Szpruch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ljeA6CMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate){:target="_blank"}. 
From 2021 to 2024, I completed my PhD at the [University of Oslo](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/){:target="_blank"} supervised by [Christos Dimitrakakis](https://sites.google.com/site/christosdimitrakakis){:target="_blank"}, and previously studied Mathematics (BSc, MSc).      



My research interests are in reinforcement learning and related topics. At the moment, I'm especially interested in problems at the intersection of machine learning and algorithmic game theory, such as strategic manipulation and approximate mechanism design.
