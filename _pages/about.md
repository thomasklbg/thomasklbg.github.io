I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow '25 at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/), mentored by [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea) and [Giorgia Ramponi](https://gioramponi.github.io/). Before that, I was at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} 
and the [University of Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, working with [Marta Kwiatkowska](https://www.trinity.ox.ac.uk/people/marta-kwiatkowska){:target="_blank"} and 
[Lukasz Szpruch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ljeA6CMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate){:target="_blank"}. 
From 2021 to 2024, I completed my PhD at the [University of Oslo](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/){:target="_blank"} with [Christos Dimitrakakis](https://sites.google.com/site/christosdimitrakakis){:target="_blank"}, and previously studied Maths (BSc, MSc).      


I work on reinforcement learning and related areas, including reward learning, preference learning, and game-theoretic approaches to problems in machine learning. Currently, I’m particularly interested in applying ideas from these areas to LLM training and alignment.
