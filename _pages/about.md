I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} 
and an Associate Member of the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, where I'm advised by [Marta Kwiatkowska](https://www.trinity.ox.ac.uk/people/marta-kwiatkowska){:target="_blank"} and 
[Lukasz Szpruch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ljeA6CMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate){:target="_blank"}. 
Between 2021 and 2024, I did my PhD at the [University of Oslo](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/){:target="_blank"} supervised by [Christos Dimitrakakis](https://sites.google.com/site/christosdimitrakakis){:target="_blank"} (yet to defend), and previously studied maths (BSc, MSc).      



My research interests lie in reinforcement learning and related topics. At the moment, I'm especially interested in problems at the intersection of online learning and algorithmic game theory, such as incentive-aware online learning and approximate mechanism design.
