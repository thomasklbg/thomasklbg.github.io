I'm currently Postdoctoral Research Associate at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) and Associate Member of the [Department of Computer Science]((https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/)) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), advised by [Marta Kwiatkowska](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=ArcH6PkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Lukasz Szpruch](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~lszpruch/). 
I did my PhD at the University of Oslo, supervised by [Christos Dimitrakakis](https://sites.google.com/site/christosdimitrakakis) (yet to defend), and previously studied Mathematics at the University of Münster.  




My research interests broadly span topics in reinforcement learning and algorithmic game theory. I'm especially interested in problems connecting these two areas such as learning in games and online mechanism design under uncertainty.

## News 

- We are organizing a workshop on [*Models of Human Feedback for AI Alignment*](https://sites.google.com/view/mhf-icml2024) at ICML 2024 in Vienna (July). Call for papers is coming out soon. 
- March 2024: I've joined the Alan Turing Institute and moved to Oxford. Let me know if you're around that area (London/Oxford/UK) and would like to chat.
