I'm a PhD student at the University of Oslo supervised by [Christos Dimitrakakis](https://sites.google.com/site/christosdimitrakakis).
Before, I studied mathematics at the University of MÃ¼nster where I was advised by [Gerold Alsmeyer](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Stochastik/en/Arbeitsgruppen/Alsmeyer/index.shtml) and [Zakhar Kabluchko](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZYBsQucAAAAJ&hl=en). 
I also completed part of my master's in the Probability Group at the University of British Columbia hosted by [Edwin Perkins](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~perkins/perkins.html). 

My research interests broadly span topics in reinforcement learning and game theory, and I'm particularly interested in their combination (e.g., learning in games, online mechanism design under uncertainty). 
Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about these or any related topics.
